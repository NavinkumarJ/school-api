# School Management API

## Overview
The **School Management API** is a Node.js-based backend system that allows users to manage school data efficiently. It provides endpoints for adding new schools and retrieving a sorted list of schools based on their proximity to a user-specified location. This API is built using **Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL** and is deployed on **Railway**.

## Features
- **Add School API**: Enables users to add a new school to the database.
- **List Schools API**: Retrieves a list of schools sorted by proximity to the user's location.
- **MySQL Database**: Stores school information, including name, address, latitude, and longitude.
- **Hosted on Railway**: Ensures easy deployment and scalability.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MySQL**
- **Railway (Hosting Platform)**

## Deployment
- The API is deployed on **Railway** with both **MySQL** and **Express.js** hosted.
- Environment variables are used for database connection security.

## Postman Collection
A Postman collection is available to test the APIs.
- Includes sample requests and expected responses.
- Can be shared with stakeholders for validation.
